# Kubeflow Alternative Cluster
This is a set of scripts for manual installation of Kubernetes,
based on Kubeadm. The rationale for those scripts is the installation
of Kubernetes 1.22 anscient release for testing Kubeflow MLOps framework.

Unfortunately the current Kubeflow version (1.6) only support [Kubernetes
1.22 release](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/releases/kubeflow-1.6/)
this is an anscient version according with the end-of-live
Kubernetes matrix: https://endoflife.date/kubernetes

As aditional note these scripts are based on RockyLinux 8.
